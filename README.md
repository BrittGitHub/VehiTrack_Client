## Wireframe

To view a first draft wireframe of the app, [click here](/public/VehiTrack_Wireframe.jpeg).

## Planning

* Began by writing out user stories
* From the user stories, I created an ERD to map out the necessary entities
* After the ERD was constructed, I designed a wireframe for which the flow of the application should follow

## Future iterations
* Allow users update maintenance memos created on the vehicles
* Display a totals section to show to total cost of maintenance per vehicle
